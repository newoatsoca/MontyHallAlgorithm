# Monty Hall Simulation in Java

This repository contains a simple Java simulation of the **Monty Hall problem**, a classic probability puzzle. The algorithm was created to better understand why **changing your choice** increases your chances of winning ‚Äî a concept that seems counterintuitive at first glance.

## Purpose

This was one of my first projects using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, created around two years ago when I was first learning Java. It applies classes and encapsulation to simulate the game and analyze the outcomes of switching versus staying with the initial choice.

## What is the Monty Hall Problem?

The Monty Hall problem is based on a game show scenario:

1. You're presented with three doors. Behind one is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats.
2. You pick a door.
3. The host, who knows what‚Äôs behind each door, opens another door ‚Äî revealing a goat.
4. You're then given a choice: stick with your original pick or switch to the remaining unopened door.

**Mathematically, switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, while staying gives only 1/3.**

## üíª Features

- Simulates the Monty Hall problem over multiple trials
- Tracks and compares outcomes when:
  - The player **switches**
  - The player **stays**
- Offers **two modes of play**:
  - **Manual mode**: Play a single game and make your own choices
  - **Simulation mode**: Run the simulation for any number of rounds to see statistical outcomes
- Uses **Object-Oriented Programming** principles

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Java
- OOP concepts (classes, methods, encapsulation)

## üöÄ How to Run
